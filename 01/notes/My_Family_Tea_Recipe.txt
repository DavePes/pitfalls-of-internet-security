A little worn, with a few faint tea stains on the corners, this recipe card has been passed down through generations. It’s more than just a recipe; it’s a cup of comfort, a hug in a mug, and the taste of home.

Grandma Eleanor’s "Sunshine in a Cup" Tea

This is the tea my grandmother would make for us on rainy afternoons, or whenever we were feeling a little under the weather. She always said it was like bottling a bit of sunshine for a dreary day.

Ingredients:

4 cups of water
2 black tea bags (a robust English Breakfast or Assam works best)
1 cinnamon stick
3 whole cloves
A thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger, thinly sliced
Peel of one small orange, trying to avoid the white pith
Honey to taste (Grandma always insisted on local wildflower honey)
A splash of milk or a slice of lemon to serve (optional)

Instructions:

In a small saucepan, combine the water, cinnamon stick, cloves, ginger slices, and orange peel.
Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes. The kitchen should start to smell wonderfully spicy and citrusy.
Turn off the heat and add the two black tea bags to the infused water. Let them steep for 3-5 minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea.
Carefully strain the tea into your favorite mugs.
Stir in honey until it dissolves and reaches your desired sweetness.
Serve as is, or with a splash of milk for a creamier texture, or a thin slice of lemon to brighten the flavors.

Enjoy the warmth and the memories in every sip.
